# [Victoria Shiny Geology](https://lachland.shinyapps.io/VicGeology_Shiny/)
Shiny R app which takes a gpx file and shows the Victorian geology which the track crosses.

GPX track files can be expoted from here: [https://www.trailhiking.com.au/map-view-victoria/](https://www.trailhiking.com.au/map-view-victoria/)

Some gpx files contain time, in which case the plot can use either distance or time as the x-axis.

Double clicking on each geology block will open a window showing the track section, the geological unit extent and more detailed information about the geology.
