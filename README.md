# [Victoria Shiny Geology](https://lachland.shinyapps.io/VicGeology_Shiny/)
Shiny R app which takes a gpx file and shows the Victorian geology which the track crosses.

GPX track files can be exported from here: [https://www.trailhiking.com.au/map-view-victoria/](https://www.trailhiking.com.au/map-view-victoria/)

Some gpx files contain time, in which case the plot can use either distance or time as the x-axis.

Zoom into parts of the plot by adjusting the slider or by highlighting a section of the plot.

Double clicking on each geology block will open a window showing the track section, the geological unit extent, and a summary of the sections geology.
